# Analyzing Text Using Azure AI Language Services

We utilized Azure Language services to analyze text, performing functions such as language detection, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, and entity recognition.

### 1. Getting Started with Azure AI Language Resource

- **We Created an Azure AI Language Resource:**
  - Accessed the Azure portal at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
  - Signed in using our Microsoft account associated with the Azure subscription.
  - Searched for "Azure AI services" and selected "Create" under Language Service.
  - Configured resource settings (subscription, resource group, region, name, pricing tier).
  - Accepted Responsible AI Notice.
  - Selected "Review + create" and waited for deployment.
  - Accessed the deployed resource to view Keys and Endpoint information.

### 2. Developing an Application in Visual Studio Code

- **We Prepared the Development Environment:**
  - Used Visual Studio Code to work on the provided code files available in a GitHub repo.
  - Cloned the repository ([GitHub - MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-language](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-language)) using Git: Clone command.
  - Opened the folder in Visual Studio Code.

- **We Configured Our Application:**
  - Installed necessary packages for Azure AI Language SDK (C# or Python) in an integrated terminal.
  - Updated configuration values in appsettings.json (for C#) or .env (for Python) with the Azure Language resource endpoint and key.

- **We Integrated Azure AI Language Functionality:**
  - Imported required namespaces in the code file.
  - Created a client for Text Analytics API using the endpoint and key from the configuration.

- **We Ran Our Program:**
  - Executed the program in the integrated terminal using the respective commands (dotnet run for C# or python text-analysis.py for Python).
  - Observed the output generated by the code.

### 3. Enhancing Functionality

- **We Added Code for Specific Tasks:**
  - Detected language.
  - Evaluated sentiment.
  - Identified key phrases.
  - Extracted entities.
  - Extracted linked entities.

- **We Executed and Observed:**
  - Ran the program after each code addition to observe the output and ensure the desired functionality was achieved.

### What We Learned

- **Provisioning Azure AI Language Resource:**
  - Understanding the steps to set up an Azure AI Language resource within the Azure portal.
  - Configuring the resource settings (subscription, region, pricing tier) for text analysis tasks.

- **Developing Applications with Azure AI Language SDK:**
  - Working with Visual Studio Code and GitHub repositories for application development.
  - Installing necessary packages and configuring application settings to integrate Azure AI Language functionalities.

- **Integrating Text Analytics Features:**
  - Importing namespaces and creating clients for Azure Text Analytics API.
  - Implementing functions for language detection, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, and entity recognition within the application code.

- **Executing and Enhancing Text Analysis:**
  - Executing the program and observing the outputs for each added functionality.
  - Understanding how to incrementally add features like language detection, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, and entity recognition to enhance text analysis capabilities.

- **Optimizing Text Analysis Tasks:**
  - Recognizing the importance of optimizing code for efficient text analysis, such as handling multiple documents and refining entity recognition.
